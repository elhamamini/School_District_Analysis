# School_District_Analysis
## Challenge
The school district discovered that the standardized test scores for ninth grade students at Thomas High School were incorrect, and they requested for updated data summaries. After further discussion, it was best to only replace the ninth grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School while keeping all other data associated with this student group intact.

Both math and reading scores were replaced with "NaN", which represents a "Not-a-Number" value, for 461 student records. Although this may seem like a significant number, these score replacements did not alter data summaries tremendously overall.

When assessing average scores and passing percentages among the 15 high schools in the school district, the average math score dropped .1, the average reading score stayed the same, the percentage passing math dropped 1%, the percentage passing reading dropped 1%, and the overall passing percent dropped 1%.
